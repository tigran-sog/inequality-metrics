Atkinson index's "inequality aversion parameter", E. It is equivalent to the income elasticity of the marginal utility of income, in other words how

## Visualising how E responds to inequalities in different parts of the income distribution

## Effect of E on the generalised means of real income distributions

## Just how differently do countries rank with Gini vs. Atkinson
